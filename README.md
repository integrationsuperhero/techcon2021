# TechCon2021 Integration and App Platform Labs
**Cloud Pak for Integration is IBM's Hybrid Integration Platform that
helps to solve..**

-   Complexity of integration where apps and data now live- on-prem,
    multiple clouds
-   Need for speed- development, architecture, and operations
-   Developer sharing and re-use of integration objects
-   Unification of integration technologies that used to be separate-
    iPaaS and API

**Cloud Pak for Integration -- Unique Value and Capabilities**

1.  **Platform navigator -** 
    The platform navigator and SSO allow you to work across and manage
    multiple integration instances all on one screen, so that you can
    work more easily, efficiently, and get to value sooner.
2.  **Common UI and integrated patterns**
    Having a common look and feel to your work is essential to help
    drive a consistent integration experience. This is especially
    important as you start building out key integration use cases and
    patterns involving multiple types of integration.
3.  **Cross Integration Tracing**
    Cross integration tracing with Open Tracing enabling faster problem
    determination and analytics.
4.  **Asset Repository**
    Architects and Developers can find and re-use integration objects
    and collaborate to speed development.
5.  **Common logging, metering, and monitoring**
    As your business scales, the number of integrations that you create
    and manage scale with it. Ensuring that you can quickly and
    effectively troubleshoot any issues across a large number of
    integrations helps to minimize disruption and drive efficiency.
6.  **License simplicity and flexibility** Rather than working on multiple pricing metrics, you can work with
    one single VPC metric. With the single VPC metric you can allocate
    and reallocate your licenses with greater flexibility. You no longer
    have to plan integration before projects begin.
7.  **Easily portable to other clouds**
    The Cloud Pak for Integration is built on RedHat OpenShift. This
    allows you to work in your desired clouds and embrace multi-cloud
    easily.
